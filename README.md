# PremScraper
A little node.js project that pulls Premier League data from https://uk.soccerway.com/national/england/premier-league/20212022/regular-season/r63396/players/

This code has also been deployed to a CI/CD pipeline on AWS which is also connected to my GitHub. 
The build stage automates the tests listed in this file.
The outputs of the build stage are then deployed to an S3 bucket.
